# Air Quality Integrator

## Challenge
Integrate NASA data, ground-based air quality data, and citizen science data to create an air quality surface that displays the most accurate data for a location and time. Create algorithms that select or weight the best data from several sources for a specific time and location, and display that information.


## Data
### Parameters
* Ozone (ppm)
* PM 10 (µg/m³): Particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter
* PM 2.5 (µg/m³): Particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter
* Sulfur Dioxide SO2 (ppm)
